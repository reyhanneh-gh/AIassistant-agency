### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This landing page was developed as part of my journey into responsive web design using Tailwind CSS. It represents a fictional AI assistant agency and includes structured sections like hero, services, testimonials, and contact—all styled with Tailwind’s flexible utility classes. The goal was to build a visually appealing and responsive layout without relying on pre-built components, focusing instead on custom design and layout control.
